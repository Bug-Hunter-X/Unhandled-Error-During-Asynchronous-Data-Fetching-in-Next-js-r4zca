# Unhandled Error During Asynchronous Data Fetching in Next.js

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications: unhandled errors during asynchronous data fetching.  The `about.js` file contains a function `fetchData` that simulates a network request. This request can fail, resulting in an error that is not gracefully handled by the application. The solution in `aboutSolution.js` demonstrates how to correctly handle this type of error, improving the user experience.

## Problem

The `fetchData` function throws an error when the simulated network request fails.  This error is not caught, leading to a crash or a broken user experience. The solution illustrates using async/await and try-catch blocks to implement proper error handling.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` shows how to use a `try-catch` block to handle potential errors during the asynchronous `fetchData` call. This approach prevents crashes and allows displaying a user-friendly message instead of a raw error message.
